		<h2>Jianbing (Chinese Crepes)</h2>
		<p>
			A common food on the street eaten for breakfast. Basically found at every street corner, its main ingredients are wheat and grain flour then fried on a griddle with an egg. It's stuffed with scallions, lettuce, cilantro, and chili sauce.

		<h2>Jiaozi (Chinese Dumplings)</h2>
		<p>
			Usually filled with veggies and/or meat, this tends to me a common street food aswell. They are shaped like ancient gold ingots, which were believed to bring you good luck. They are often shallow fried or deep-fried and eaten with a dip of soy-vinegar sauce for flavor. Also really popular on Chinese New Year.
