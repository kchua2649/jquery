		<h2>Cifantuan or Ci Faan (Glutinous rice balls)</h2>
		<p>
			Rice balls filled with various flavorful local ingredients. The most common types are the savory kinds. These include aha cai (pickled vegetable), rousing (pork floss) and youtiao (long golden-brown strips of deep-fried dough). There are also the sweet variations, which consist of the same ingredients as the savory one but with added sugar as well as sesame.

		<h2>Jiaozi (Chinese Dumplings)</h2>

			Usually filled with veggies and/or meat, this tends to me a common street food aswell. They are shaped like ancient gold ingots, which were believed to bring you good luck. They are often shallow fried or deep-fried and eaten with a dip of soy-vinegar sauce for flavor. Also really popular on Chinese New Year.
