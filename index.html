		<h2>Cifantuan or Ci Faan (Glutinous rice balls)</h2>

			Rice balls filled with various flavorful local ingredients. The most common types are the savory kinds. These include aha cai (pickled vegetable), rousing (pork floss) and youtiao (long golden-brown strips of deep-fried dough). There are also the sweet variations, which consist of the same ingredients as the savory one but with added sugar as well as sesame.
